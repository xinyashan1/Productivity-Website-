        <p>Our challenge was to create a solution where people don't loose track of their organization flow and stay sane. During times like this it is crucial to 
            make sure that there is still room left to complete your tasks. In addition to that our goal is to design a technical solution so that people can be apart of
            the digital transformation.

          <p>To create a application that helps boost productivity while de-stressing 10 times faster! Our goal is to make sure that people believe in this product and so
            we decided to create a Self care club as well.

            a smart water bottle, motivational plush, and subscription box goodie that can be delivered faster than speed of light.

            <p>Our project was introduced to several people during Demo day and they've given us a lot of wonderful feedback about how we can further develop this into reality. Although 
              it is just a idea right now it has a solid foundation. 
              <li>"I would buy it!"</li>
              <li>"I've work at home a lot more these days and this would really help me"</li>
              <li>"The concept is unique and making it into a extension maybe better!"</li>
              <li>"I would love to see this in the market and I would defiantly buy it for a higher price! Don't sell yourself short!"

            <p>Although we only had eight weeks to create this from scratch I can safely say we have a decent way of presenting our idea. In 
              the beginning we originally wanted to come up with a AR idea but then we started over again. I think it was thanks to the teams fast
              teamwork, brainstorming sessions, and all the skills we had combined where we were able to have a head start. We were already ahead of 
              agenda and so as a result we were able to change our idea without any issues.

        <div class="block"></div>
        <p>Our team was set-up based on our skills that were divided into four types of personas. 
          Types will include: Hacker, hipster, handler, and Hustler, and each team are well balanced out with ranging from four to five members each. 
          Although teams may have more than one type usually people also take on two personas such as being a hacker/hipster which is someone who is good at developing software and able to design it at the same time. Or another example could be a Hacker Hustler someone who can develop and work at a fast pace. So although there may be similar types everyone also has something else they're good at which helps out the team a lot.

        <div class="one-third column">
          <h3>Design</h3>
          <p>The logo, calendar, and wireframes were designed by Joseph! So we've brainstormed a lot of different themes and we concluded blue would be the main color. In addition according to marketing psychology blue is color that makes people feel calm. In addition to our brainstorming sessions, we've concluded that there are colors that make people feel calmer and relax and so because this app is designed to delete the stress the colors being decided have been thought out carefully. On top of that sometimes there are those colors that make people more anxious. For example, red because it reminds of people of the errors they've made when they get back that homework assignment. Therefore as a result we try to stay away from colors that trigger those feelings.

          <h3>Plaforms</h3>
          <p>For this project, some of the things that will be presented are Pitch Presentation, UI/UX design that focuses on additional features, graphic designs, and research that discusses self-care, psychology, and the importance of being healthy both mentally and physically. Our main focus is to increase productivity and focus on getting things done with the least amount of distraction and stress. Even though the virtual life may not be everyone's cup of tea we sincerely hope that at least some of our ideas can help out even if it is just a tiny bit. 
            Furthermore, this product's main objective is to assure that people are forming better habits so they are the best version of themselves. As for versions we've decided it is best to include versions for slack, microsoft office and google extension so that it be available for
          a wide range of people in different platform communities. </p>

          <h3>Digital World</h3>
          <p> Since life, as we know it has changed and gone digital, is the main source of staying in communication for most people we figure that creating an application would be the best product to get produced during a time like this. First, we were given three different challenges to choose from. We collectively decided it is best to develop an idea where we would design something user-friendly, affordable, and relatable for everyone. 
            Based on our research and brainstorming sessions we've concluded that most people dislike online classes and so we wanted to turn that problem into a solution for those who do not cope well with the remote life. In the meantime, we have also asked for a lot of feedback on how we are doing and some mentors mentioned they are already used to working from home and the majority suggest a system where color-coded calendars would help them out a lot.
